### Using dashboards.ly with [plotly on-premise](https://plot.ly/product/enterprise)
dashboards.ly is a beta plotly product and doesn't ship with plotly on-premise. You can easily deploy your own dashboards.ly with one-click on heroku.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/plotly/dashboards.ly)

You'll need to provide your heroku instance of dashboards.ly network access to your on-premise instance of plotly.
